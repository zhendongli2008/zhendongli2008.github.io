We are interested in developing new electronic methods for describing strongly correlated systems in chemistry based on new insights and technologies from condense matter physics, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.


We are interested in developing new electronic methods for describing strongly correlated systems in chemistry based on new insights and technologies from condense matter physics, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.

## Quantum algorithms for electronic structure problems

We are the first to develop quantum algorithms for molecular response properties[1] and perform real experimental simulation of molecular absorption spectra on quantum hardware[2].

## High performance computing for strong electron correlation

We developed the first distributed multi-GPU ab initio DMRG algorithm[1], and proposed an efficient relativistic DMRG algorithm using time-reversal symmetry[2].
