Chemical systems with transition metal centers have fascinating functionalities in catalysis and illuminessence. However, these systems remain difficult to be studied computationaly. From the electronic structure aspect, major theoretical challenges involve:

1. **Strong correlation**: requiring efficient methods for large active space (~100 d/f orbitals)
2. **Dynamic correlation**: requiring nonperturbative, beyond MRPT2 for chemical accuracy
3. **Excited states**: requiring a balanced treatment for different types of excitations (local and delocalized)
4. **Spectroscopies** (EPR/X-ray/MoÌˆssbauer): requiring relativistic effects (SOC)
5. **Environments**: requiring the ability to handle large systems

We are interested in developing new electronic methods for describing these strongly correlated systems in chemistry based on new insights and technologies from condense matter physics, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. If you are interested in this direction, you can find our articles on [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MYZZUJ0AAAAJ&hl=en). Topics we are currently working on includes:

## 1. Quantum algorithms for electronic structure problems

We are the first to develop quantum algorithms for molecular response properties[1] and perform real experimental simulation of molecular absorption spectra on quantum hardware[2].

## 2. High performance computing for strong electron correlation

We developed the first distributed multi-GPU ab initio DMRG algorithm[1], and proposed an efficient relativistic DMRG algorithm using time-reversal symmetry[2].
