I obtained my B.S. in Chemistry and Mathematics at the Peking University, China, in 2009, and received my Ph.D. at the Peking University in Quantum Chemistry in 2014, where I worked with Prof. Wenjian Liu on the developments of theoretical methods for excited states of open-shell molecules, relativistic quantum chemistry, and group theoretical approaches for symbolic algebra for tensor expressions. I joined Prof. Garnet Chanâ€™s group as a postdoc at Princeton University in 2014 and then moved to Caltech in 2016, where I worked on the development of new numerical methods based on tensor network states such as the matrix product states for the strong electron correlation problem as well as applications of these tools to challenging metalloenzymes. In 2019, I joined Beijing Normal University as a professor in College of Chemistry. 

## Research Interests

Our current interests lie in understanding the structure of quantum many-body wavefunctions through the lens of perturbation theories, tensor network, neural networks, and quantum computing. Some topics we are working on include:

- Quantum algorithms for electronic structure problems
- High performance computing for strong electron correlation
- Diagrammatic methods for dynamical correlation
- Wavefunction ansatz inspired from neural networks
- Excited state methods based on wavefunction and time-dependent density functional theory

## Openings

We are looking for self-motivated and talented students and postdocs, who are interested in the development and application of electronic structure methods. If you have a strong background in physical chemistry, computational physics, applied math, or computer programming, we encourage you to apply by sending an email along with your CV and a brief description of research skills.
